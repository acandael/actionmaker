The website is implemented with the Static Sitegenerator [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) .This project has a heavy focus on images. Therefore I needed all kinds of techniques to make the pages load fast.

Techniques I used are:

* Sprites
* the srcset attribute

For details about the latest technique, I refer to my blogpost on the  [srcset attribute](https://www.anthonycandaele.com/blog/2015/05/25/responsive-images-using-srcset-and-jquery)

I also used a couple of jQuery libraries for responsive sliders and image
galleries:

* [bxSlider](http://bxslider.com/)
* [Magnific Popup](http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/)

For the styling and layout I used a couple of Sass libraries:

* [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) (a Sass mixin library)
* [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) (a semantic grid framework)
